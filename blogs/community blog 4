4   PSF Logo

D. Goodger will send the candidate PSF logos (from Marc-André Lemburg and himself) to the members for comment, noting that the Board intends to choose one at the next meeting.

5   Treasurer's Report
K. Kaiser reported that the accounts are reconciled through February, and he's working on March. The biggest problem is collections. Roughly $100K is outstanding in accounts receivable.

S. Holden will assist K. Kaiser with accounts receivable reminders.

D. Goodger asked that they coordinate with Van Lindberg, who sent out invoices to PyCon sponsors.

D. Goodger reported that he will be going over the PyCon hotel bill with CTE this week, but it looks fine.

K. Kaiser sent a statement of accounts receivable to the Board mailing list.

6   PyCon 2009 Venue

RESOLVED, that the PyCon chairman be authorized to choose the venue for PyCon 2009.
Approved 7-0-1.

7   PyCon Asset Record-Keeping
D. Goodger will update the assets file in PSF CVS with the details of the laptops and VGA2USB boxes purchased for PyCon 2008.

8   PSF Awards Program
D. Goodger reported that there is now a python.org page that records the recipients of the PSF Community Awards.

S. Holden will have PSF Community Award certificates designed.

9   PyCon FR Sponsorship
Tarek Ziadé has requested PSF sponsorship for PyCon FR 2008, a.k.a. "Journées Python" ("Python Days", France). Originally the request was for a gold-level sponsorship (400 Euros), but their financial needs have since been met by sponsors. The request was revised; Tarek asked for the PSF's help with publicity. The Board naturally agreed to this.

S. Holden will publicize PyCon FR 2008 on the PSF blog.
D. Goodger will publicize PyCon FR 2008 on the PyCon blog.
D. Goodger suggested sending swag, such as stickers like those produced for PyCon in the US. R. Hettinger suggested sponsoring a speaker from overseas, and the Board agreed.

S. Holden will inform Tarek Ziadé of PyCon FR that they may use the PSF logo on the sponsor list, that the PSF will provide some publicity, and that the PSF may be able to assist by funding the travel for one invited speaker.
S. Holden will ask the French Python Association to revise their logo, which uses a derivative of the obsolete Python graphic.
10   2008 Frank Willison Award
D. Goodger noted that O'Reilly needs about 1 month notice before OSCON. S. Holden suggested that a decision at the June meeting at the latest, but May would give the recipient more time to plan OSCON attendance.

D. Goodger will ask Guido van Rossum for his input on the 2008 Frank Willison Award. Assuming Guido delegates the decision to the Board, David will ask previous recipients and the PSF membership at large for nominations, to be submitted no later than Friday May 9.

11   PyCon 2008
D. Goodger reported:

I think [PyCon 2008] was a success. There were some issues, but we'll fix them next year. I've been posting my report in sections to the PyCon blog, almost done.
S. Holden:

I enjoyed it more that any other. The reports have been great.
12   Sponsor Membership Issues
S. Holden reported that Industrial Light & Magic have paid their membership fee for this year. There's no real basis for chasing them for back dues while emeritus though.

D. Goodger noted that we'll need a new application from ILM, for a vote at next year's members meeting.

S. Holden will contact ILM to request a new sponsor membership application.

S. Holden will contact AT Battery to inform them of the results of their sponsor membership application (election at members' meeting).

D. Goodger noted that in the past we haven't put pending sponsor's logos on the web page, and asked if we should change that policy. The issue was not discussed.

D. Goodger will update the member information in members.xls (sponsors & nominated members) & sponsor-addrs.txt, in PSF CVS.

D. Goodger noted that the representative of sponsor member Hostway was recently unsubscribed from psf-members. T. Peters reported that this was due to "user unknown" bounces. Perhaps the representative has left the sponsor organization.

D. Goodger will inquire with sponsor Hostway about the unsubscribed PSF representative.

K. Kaiser asked about the OSAF 2007 sponsor invoice. OSAF converted to emeritus status in 2008, but the 2007 sponsor invoice is still outstanding

S. Holden will contact OSAF and inquire about their outstanding 2007 PSF sponsor invoice.

13   Adjournment
S. Holden adjourned the meeting at 17:00 UTC.
